# TunaDB üêü
A key-value store written in Rust for learning purposes. Inspired by the book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann.

### Technical details
It currently uses a simple length-prefixed binary encoding format for storage files and an in-memory byte offset HashMap as its indexing strategy. The server communicates with clients over TCP sockets and uses protocol buffers for data serialization.

Implementation details, including the storage/indexing algorithms and communication protocols, are abstracted and subject to change. There are plans to implement more sophisticated data structures, such as B-Trees and LSM-Trees, in the future, as well as a custom communication protocol.
## Build

### Requirements
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
- [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarkelCA/tunadb.git
cd tunadb
# For the server
cargo install --path ./server
# For the client
cargo install --path ./cli
```

## Usage
### server
You can check the server parameters with `tuna-server --help`:
```
