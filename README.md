# TunaDB üêü
A key-value storage system written in Rust for learning purposes. It currently uses a simple length-prefixed binary encoding format for storage files and an in-memory byte offset HashMap as its indexing strategy. The server uses protocol buffers for communication with clients and is implemented using the gRPC framework. The client is a simple command-line interface that allows users to interact with the server using a TCP connection.

Implementation details, including the storage/indexing algorithms and communication protocols, are abstracted and subject to change. There are plans to implement more sophisticated data structures, such as B-Trees and LSM-Trees, in the future, as well as a custom protocol for communication between the server and clients.
## Build

### Requirements
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

# For tcp server
cargo install --path ./tcp
```


## Usage
### cli
```
$ tuna
